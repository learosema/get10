# get10
a simple game :). The aim of the game is to decrement a tile to zero. To decrement a tile, you need at least 2 adjacent tiles with same numbers. This game was made in the #50Lines||less challenge at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). I didn't manage to keep it in 50 loc because I don't want to make the code less readable than it actually is right now, but it was a heck of a good try.
